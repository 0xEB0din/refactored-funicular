    Validate token burn for access.

    This function is a placeholder for actual token validation logic.
    In a real-world scenario, it would interact with a token system or smart contract
    to verify if the consumer has burned the required amount of tokens.

    Args:
        consumer_address (str): Address of the consumer performing token burn.
        token_amount (int): Amount of tokens burned.

    Returns:
        bool: True if token burn is valid, False otherwise.
